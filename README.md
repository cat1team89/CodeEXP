To tackle the issue of loneliness among NSFs, our team developed freNS, an app to connect NSFs and build their network of support.

Powered _React Native and Firebase_, this app allows users to **propose, explore and attend events** within their respective camps. Users can **contact one another through the chat** function without having to exchange their personal phone numbers. **Helplines and websites** for mental health support are also accessible via the profile page.

Future extensions include _filtering profiles by similar interests_, supporting _multiplayer games_ in chats, handling _equipment loaning_ requests between users, and _mentorship_ from NSmen who have ORD-ed.
